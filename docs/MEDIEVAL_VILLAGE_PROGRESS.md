## 📸 TESTING REQUIRED

**Please test in Godot and report:**

1. **Visual Appearance**
   - Do buildings render correctly?
   - Are materials/textures visible (not white)?
   - Do roofs sit properly on walls?
   - Are corners connecting walls?

2. **Scale Check**
   - Are buildings appropriately sized?
   - Is the village layout functional for gameplay?
   - Can player navigate around buildings?

3. **Technical Issues**
   - Any missing models?
   - Any rotation/position errors?
   - Does scene load without errors?

## 🎮 GAMEPLAY CONSIDERATIONS

### Cover System
- Buildings provide high cover
- Wagon provides medium cover
- Fences provide low cover/barriers

### Navigation
- Central courtyard open for movement
- Buildings positioned to not block gameplay
- Perimeter has circulation space

### Visual Landmarks
- North tower: Primary landmark, enemy direction
- Side houses: Left/right orientation
- South buildings: Player base area
